***Data for the assessment of accuracy's SPRISS and its application in metagenomics
Run SPRISS/scripts/download_ds.py: it downloads the HMP datasets and creates the GOSdatasets and MOBdatasets empty folders for the GOS, B73 and Mo17 datasets.

At https://www.imicrobe.us/#/samples you need to download the "*.fa" datasets of reads of the GS0XX samples, where XX is in {02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,47,51} and put them in SAKEIMA/scripts/GOSdatasets. 

At https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP082260 you need to: download B73 Rep 1 and 2, uncompress them in fastq format and append of the two file to the other in a file called "B73.fastq"; download Mo17 Rep 1 and 2, uncompress them in fastq format and append of the two file to the other in a file called "Mo17.fastq"; put "B73.fastq" and "Mo17.fastq" datasets in SPRISS/scripts/MOBdatasets.


***SNP genotyping application of SPRISS
Run SPRISS/genotyping_application/get_data/get_data.py: it downloads the dataset of coverage 75x used for the SNP genotyping application of SPRISS from https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/giab_data_indexes --> NA12878:HG001 https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/data/NA12878/
Download hg19.fa from http://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/lava/data/hg19.fa.gz and put it in SPRISS/genotyping_application/
Download NA12878.vcf.gz from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fun0X2x8_7uDqzGNiT4CfXQVU6uKyPLV/view?usp=sharing and put it in SPRISS/genotyping_application/
Download hg19Common.vcf from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5H8GW83HWML4e3o8oO0rV9KVBNzicRE/view?usp=sharing and put it in SPRISS/genotyping_application/
Download ConfidentRegions.bed.gz from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EPmVLWh4sagoaan1vueEI_0jiWELOJv9/view?usp=sharing and put it in SPRISS/genotyping_application/
